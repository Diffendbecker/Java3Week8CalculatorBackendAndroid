I'm not strong in Android Depelopment... I've used...

StrictMode.ThreadPolicy policy = new StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder().permitAll().build();
StrictMode.setThreadPolicy(policy);

It shouldn't be ever used it in production, according to my research.
The best way - to use Tasks, but my Android and Java knowledge is not so deep.
